        <h3>The Life</h3>
        <li>
          <b>Born:</b> June 2014 with his sibling pups into a Mexican family
          from New Jersey, US
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Drama:</b> Within a year of life, issues of aggression towards
          other dogs, including his own sister, prompted for him to be raised
          independent of other animals in the household
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Result:</b> Although he grows up without much interaction with
          other dogs, he becomes a child favorite as he is inexplicable smitten
          with kids and young adults while maintaining his protective aggression
          with other puppies
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Currently:</b> Enjoys a semi-sendentary retired life that is
          predicated on leisurely walks (away from dogs), playing in the yard
          during nice sunny days, and plenty of sleep throughout the day
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul id="tribute-page-right">
        <h3>The Style</h3>
        <li>
          <b>Fur:</b> With a thick coat of shiny fur about 0.5-1.0 inches long,
          he is always looking sleek and well kept. Monthly trips to the groomer
          always makes sure his nails are maintained and cleanliness up to date
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Health:</b> Though he went through a recent seizure scare, his
          style is unchanged. His overall health is great, though perhaps a
          little husky. He enjoy frequent treats for being so well-behaved
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Play Style:</b> Though he is heavy at over 80 pounds, he is very
          active with horsing around. You can catch him joining in on workout
          sessions with adults or battling it out against his toy rope
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Hunting:</b> Despite his size, he enjoys hunting critters much
          faster than him. However, he is inexplicably also known to get scared
          of some harmless creatures, such as your occasional opposum
        </li>
      </ul>
